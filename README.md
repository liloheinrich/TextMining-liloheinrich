# Text Mining
Repository for Mini Project 3: Text Mining

## Markov Text Generation of Political News Headlines
What I did:
* Scraped html of news sites for headlines: CNN, Fox, Politico, Washington Post, New York Times
* Used markov chains to generate fake news

What I found out:
* Chains longer than one word donâ€™t have many diverging options due to dataset size
* Varying degrees of believability/readability (markov chains not an ideal way to implement)

Examples:
